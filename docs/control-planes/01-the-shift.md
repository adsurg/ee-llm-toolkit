# The Shift

## What changes when you work with an LLM

The instinct is to treat an LLM coding assistant like a faster typist — you tell it what to type, it types it, you review. This works, but it's like using a car to push a shopping trolley. Technically functional, dramatically underselling the tool.

The shift is this: **you become the architect, the LLM becomes the builder.** Not because it can't make architectural decisions — it often can — but because you're the one who knows why this system exists, who it serves, and what trade-offs are acceptable. That's the job that doesn't automate well. The mechanical translation of a clear design into working code is the job that does.

This isn't about "prompt engineering." It's about engineering discipline — the same discipline that makes human teams productive — applied to a different kind of collaborator.

## Declarative over imperative

When working with a human developer, you don't dictate keystrokes. You describe what you want, explain the constraints, and trust them to find a good implementation. The same approach works dramatically better with LLMs than line-by-line instruction.

**Imperative** (what most people do):

> "Create a file called UserService.ts. Add a method called getUser that takes an id parameter of type string and returns a Promise of User. Inside the method, call the database..."

**Declarative** (what works better):

> "We need a user lookup service. It should work through the repository interface we defined in the architecture doc. Users are identified by UUID. The service shouldn't know about the database — that's the repository's concern."

The declarative version gives the LLM room to make good mechanical decisions (naming, error handling, edge cases) while keeping you in control of the ones that matter (boundaries, coupling, abstraction level).

This only works if the LLM has enough context to fill in the gaps correctly. That's where the control plane comes in — and, as a useful side effect, it substantially reduces how many tokens each conversation burns, because the LLM isn't rebuilding context every session.

## Trust and guardrails

Every productive working relationship is built on trust. Trust doesn't mean blind faith — it means establishing shared expectations and then not second-guessing every step.

With an LLM, trust is built through **guardrails**: project-level documents that define how things should be done. Coding standards. Architectural boundaries. Naming conventions. Testing expectations. When these are written down and loaded into context, you don't need to repeat them in every conversation. The LLM follows them because they're part of its working context, the same way a developer follows team norms after reading the contributing guide.

The pattern is:

1. **Define the guardrail once** — write it in a conventions doc, a CLAUDE.md, or a rule file
2. **Load it automatically** — the LLM reads it at the start of every conversation
3. **Trust it** — don't re-state what's already written
4. **Correct when needed** — save the correction as a new guardrail so it sticks

### What guardrails cover

Guardrails aren't just style rules. A working set usually covers:

- **Architectural boundaries** — what depends on what, what each module is allowed to know about
- **Conventions** — naming, file layout, error handling, logging, configuration
- **Testing expectations** — what must be tested, at what level, and what "tested" means in this codebase
- **Security and data handling** — what's sensitive, where secrets live, what never gets logged
- **Dependency policy** — when a new dependency is acceptable and what the criteria are
- **Scope limits** — what the LLM shouldn't touch without asking (migrations, CI config, shared infrastructure)

Anything a new team member would need explained goes here. If you find yourself giving the same correction twice, it's a missing guardrail.

### Docs are one layer — you have more

Written guardrails are the soft layer. They work because the LLM reads them, but reading isn't enforcement. The real safety comes from composing them with the hard layers you already run: type checkers, linters, tests, pre-commit hooks, CI, and code review. An LLM working inside that system fails the same way a human does — noisily, against checks that reject the output — and iterates until it doesn't.

Docs tell it what "good" means; tooling stops it when it drifts; permissions bound what drift is even possible; your review is the final layer. Together they're tighter in practice than most human-only workflows — and considerably tighter than the setup people imagine when they hear "AI writing code."

### Catching and fixing issues

The legitimate worry is that LLMs produce plausible output that can be wrong, confidently. What makes that risk containable is that the output lands inside the same engineering system you already run. Type checks, linters, tests, CI, review — these catch machine-generated mistakes for the same reason they catch human ones. The difference is that an LLM iterates against those checks faster than a human, and without getting demoralised.

The feedback loop, fastest to slowest: editor → pre-commit → tests → CI → your review. Each layer that fires before you do is one you don't personally have to police. Investment in the earlier layers compounds — the LLM sees failures sooner, self-corrects, and you see output only once it's survived the automated passes.

The goal isn't to eliminate review; it's to move review onto the parts that need human judgement — boundaries, intent, trade-offs — and off the parts a machine can check. Done well, this stops the human being the rate limiter. You watch less, trust more, and review in bigger, less frequent chunks. That shift isn't about the LLM getting better; it's about the system around it getting tighter.

Signals the system is tightening:

- Tests pass on the first or second try
- Review finds design questions, not style ones
- You stop giving the same correction across conversations
- You're comfortable reviewing bigger diffs, less often

Signals it isn't:

- Plausible code quietly violates a boundary → the guardrail is too vague, or not in the right context file
- The same mistake appears in multiple projects → it belongs in the control plane, not a single project
- You feel you have to read every line → the earlier layers aren't doing enough work yet; invest there

When something does get through, it's almost always the guardrail: too vague, not loaded into the right conversation, contradicted by another doc, or not covering this case yet. Fix it at its source and the class of mistake doesn't recur. The system gets incrementally harder to break with every correction, which is what earns the trust in the first place.

This is the same pattern good engineering teams use. The difference is that an LLM actually reads the docs.

## Human in the loop — but as a partner

There's a spectrum of how people work with LLMs:

**Micromanager** — dictates every line, reviews every character, doesn't trust the output. Gets exactly what they'd have written themselves, slower.

**Rubber stamper** — accepts everything, doesn't review, ships whatever comes out. Gets working code until it doesn't, then can't debug it because they never understood it.

**Partner** — sets direction, defines constraints, reviews at the level that matters (architecture, behaviour, edge cases), delegates the mechanical work. Catches the LLM's blind spots (it can't see your users, your ops setup, your team's pain points) while letting it handle what it's good at (consistent implementation, broad pattern knowledge, untiring attention to boilerplate).

The partner model is what this toolkit is designed to support. You're not supervising a junior developer. You're collaborating with a very fast, very well-read colleague who has no memory of yesterday and no understanding of your business — unless you write it down.

## Everyone doing what they're best at

Humans are good at:

- Understanding why a system exists and who it serves
- Making trade-off decisions with incomplete information
- Recognising when something feels wrong before they can articulate why
- Navigating ambiguity, politics, and competing priorities
- Knowing what to build next

LLMs are good at:

- Translating a clear specification into consistent code
- Applying patterns across a large codebase without fatigue
- Holding many files in working memory simultaneously
- Following written conventions reliably (more reliably than most humans)
- Producing boilerplate, tests, migrations, and glue code at speed

The shift isn't about replacing developers. It's about freeing developers to spend their time on the work that actually requires human judgment — and having the mechanical work done quickly, consistently, and at a quality level set by the guardrails you've defined.

## Central documents boost everyone

Here's the thing people miss: the documents you write to give the LLM context are **also the best onboarding docs your team has ever had.**

A clear architecture document, a conventions guide, a decision log — these help every new team member, every returning-from-holiday developer, and every future version of you who's forgotten why that module exists. The LLM is just the forcing function that makes you write them.

Projects that adopt this approach consistently report that the documentation isn't overhead — it's the most valuable artefact of the process. It makes the humans faster too. Anecdotally, it also makes the LLM bill considerably smaller: practitioners on this approach routinely report spending a fraction of what colleagues on the same tools spend without the structure, because the LLM isn't re-deriving the project on every conversation.

## Bringing people on the journey

If you're reading this and thinking "I just want to know what to type" — that's fine. Start with the [control plane guide](02-control-plane.md) and follow the steps. The structure will teach you the thinking as you use it.

If you're reading this and thinking "this sounds like a lot of upfront work" — it is, the first time. But the documents you write in the first hour save hundreds of hours of re-explanation across every conversation that follows. The ROI is fast and it compounds.

If you're reading this and thinking "I already know how to code, I don't need this" — you're right, you don't need it to write code. You need it to write code _with an LLM_ at a level that's worth the disruption to your existing workflow. Without structure, the LLM is a novelty. With structure, it's a multiplier.
